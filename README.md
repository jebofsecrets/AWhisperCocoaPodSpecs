AWhisperCocoaPodSpecs
=====================

This is a repo to hold podspecs for homebrewed Whisper CocoaPods, forks of other CocoaPods, etc. Why does it begin with 'A'? Because CocoaPods searches pod repos alphabetically, and if you fork an existing pod in the master repo and it comes up first (As it would if this repo began with a letter like say 'W' or 'S'), we'd pod install the master version rather than our forked version.
